          Hello I am Stan, I have been working as an engineer for six years. Three years on front-end, three years on back-end. I have been spending my spare time discovering
          and learning new techniques. I think Itâ€™s important to discuss with my co-workers about how to build better system architecture and use it on the official web
          application. Ideas sharing and team discussion play an essential part in the front-end technology. Researching the React landscape and its new trend will sure benefit
          our team.
